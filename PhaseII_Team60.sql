-- Aidan Wu (awu359)
-- Directions:
-- Please follow all instructions for Phase II as listed on Canvas.
-- Fill in the team number and names and GT usernames for all members above.
-- Create Table statements must be manually written, not taken from an SQL Dump file.
-- This file must run without error for credit.
/* This is a standard preamble for most of our scripts. The intent is to establish
a consistent environment for the database behavior. */

works for you. When executed, your statements must create a functional database
that contains
all of the data, and supports as many of the constraints as reasonably possible. */
